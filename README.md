GH#: A C# Dictionary of Grasshopper3D Components

## Description
TBD.

## Contribute
If you would like to contribute to the project, we suggest the following:

- First, take a look at the work we have done so far! All files are in the `src` folder, with the `Math`, `Vector`, `Intersect` and `Mesh` categories in fairly good shape so far! Browse through the files, double-click on the C# components and get a general sense of what the project is about!

- Read the [guidelines](GUIDELINES.md) document on the overall principles on how to develop more components.

- Reach out to [@garciadelcastillo](https://github.com/garciadelcastillo) to request a link to the spreadsheet where we are keeping track of the work pending, and if you have any questions.

- Give it a try, either by developing some already made components to warm up, or by tackling new ones that are still undeveloped! 

- Submit your contributions by sending your files to [@garciadelcastillo](https://github.com/garciadelcastillo) or submitting a pull request.

Thanks for your contribution!
